Burger ORM app
This app demonstrates the capabilities of a node.js app utilizing Express and a custom-built ORM to interface with a MySQL database. Burgers can be added, deleted or modified. All commands are parsed through JavaScript into MySQL commands to manipulate the data. The front-end is rendered by Express Handlebars.
